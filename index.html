    <div id="about">ABOUT</div>
    <div id="about_text">Ilan E. Belokon is a native New Yorker hailing from the
    afamed borough of Brooklyn. If you couldn't tell from
    this website his coding skills beg some much needed attention. Instead he spends his days
    willfully sketching away whilst complaining about the materiality of life at a liberal college
    neither he nor 30% of the school population could actually afford without scholarship.
    However, while desperatly attending a
    class in computer programming at Parson's School of Design
    ,where he is a Communication Design Major, Ilan has gained some programming knowledge.
    As encouraging as this is we would like to note, in fine print, that:
